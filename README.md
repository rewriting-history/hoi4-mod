No need for a README, let's just write our goals here.

1. Serbo-Bulgaria Focus tree from this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QYivutwgm0&t=540s&ab_channel=RewritingHistory
- The idea is to have an event where they break away from the Ottoman Empire, then they start the First Balkan war with Greece and Montenegro. Then there is a second balkan war, just like in the video
- I (Kat) will be dealing with Serbo-Bulgaria

2. Research fix
- Some technologies are not fixed to be used in 1910. We can move the support equipment, artilery, industry, and electronics to 1910. The Tanks and Airplans we can ingnore, or make them available in 1915-1918.

3. Make custom Cavlary Units
- Make the Cavlary template have horses as required equipment. Horses can be the first version of Motorized, we just change the icon and everything.
