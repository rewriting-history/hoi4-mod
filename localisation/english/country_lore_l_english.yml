  RGW_lore.1.t:0 "The History Of Monaco" 
  RGW_lore.1.d:0 "Monaco came to rule over France in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War. The way this was achieved was by the incopetence of the French Monarch - Napoleon III. He was lacking funding for the war, so he decided to gamble French territory in Monte Carlo. \n\n Due to unfortuante streak of events, he had lost everything. The people mostly accepted the House of Monaco ruling over France, but some think it's time for a change. \n\n After the House of Monaco took over, they put their economic model on what used to be France. This means that the people of Monaco don't pay any taxes, instead, money for the government is received from the many Casinos that opened in Monaco. \n\n Watch "What if Monaco formed France in 1871?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.2.t:0 "The History Of Serbo-Bulgaria" 
  RGW_lore.2.d:0 "The Union between Serbia and Bulgaria is a complicated topic. Britain, France, and Austria were against a strong and united Bulgaria after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878. This is because these countries didn't want Russia to became stronger and to upset the balance of power in the Balkans. \n\n This is why the San Stefano Treaty was replaced with the Treaty of Berlin, limiting Bulgaria's size and the Russian influence in the country. An idea that would secure both Strong and United Bulgaria and no Russian influence is the merging of Greater Bulgaria and Serbia into Yugoslavia \n\n The Serbian King Milan Obrenovich IV would become king of the Bulgarians too, rather than the Russian nephew as it was historically. \n\n The name of the country would be Serbo-Bulgaria, rather than Yugoslavia. The reason for that is that Austria holds a large South Slavic minority. \n\n Watch "What if Greater Yugoslavia formed before WW1?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"
