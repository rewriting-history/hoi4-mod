  RGW_lore.1.t:0 "The History Of Monaco" 
  RGW_lore.1.d:0 "Monaco came to rule over France in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War. The way this was achieved was by the incopetence of the French Monarch - Napoleon III. He was lacking funding for the war, so he decided to gamble French territory in Monte Carlo. \n\n Due to unfortuante streak of events, he had lost everything. The people mostly accepted the House of Monaco ruling over France, but some think it's time for a change. \n\n After the House of Monaco took over, they put their economic model on what used to be France. This means that the people of Monaco don't pay any taxes, instead, money for the government is received from the many Casinos that opened in Monaco. \n\n Watch "What if Monaco formed France in 1871?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.2.t:0 "The History Of Serbo-Bulgaria" 
  RGW_lore.2.d:0 "The Union between Serbia and Bulgaria is a complicated topic. Britain, France, and Austria were against a strong and united Bulgaria after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878. This is because these countries didn't want Russia to became stronger and to upset the balance of power in the Balkans. \n\n This is why the San Stefano Treaty was replaced with the Treaty of Berlin, limiting Bulgaria's size and the Russian influence in the country. An idea that would secure both Strong and United Bulgaria and no Russian influence is the merging of Greater Bulgaria and Serbia into Yugoslavia \n\n The Serbian King Milan Obrenovich IV would become king of the Bulgarians too, rather than the Russian nephew as it was historically. \n\n The name of the country would be Serbo-Bulgaria, rather than Yugoslavia. The reason for that is that Austria holds a large South Slavic minority. \n\n Watch "What if Greater Yugoslavia formed before WW1?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.3.t:0 "History Of San Marino"
  RGW_lore.3.d:0 "San Marino became a player in the Appenine Peninsula when Napoleon Bonaparte of France rose to power. Napoleon liked San Marino and wrote in a letter to the country, offering to extend their size accoding to their needs. \n\n San Marino takes the offer and gets access to the Adriatic Sea and the province of Tuscany, and befriend the Pope. Sardinia-Piedmont was expanding in the North of Italy, so they felt confident they can take San Marino. Sardinia-Piedmont chose to sell the province of Annecy to Switzerland, so they can have more funding for the war. \n\n San Marino was victorious and didn't take any land directly, but allowed Austria to take Sardinia, and San Marino gained Lombardy-Veneto. San Marino united all of Northern Italy and after Guiseppe Garibaldi's expedition to the Two Sicilies, the country was given to San Marino. In 1865 San Marino and the Papal States united, finally uniting the Appenine Peninsula. \n\n San Marino made a deal with the Ottoman Empire, which allowed the Republic to annex Libya and Tunisia, in exchange for guarantees as to not invade. San Marino pressured Monaco to do the same. \n\n Watch "What if Napoleon helped San Marino to form Italy?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.4.t:0 "History Of Liechtenstein"
  RGW_lore.4.d:0 "After the Russians lost the Crimean war, they were looking to sell Alaska. In the end, Liechtenstein would purchase the land in 1867, with the intentions to sell it later for a profit. \n\n Liechtenstein would help the Russians pay for the Trans-Siberian Railroad and in compensation, they will gain Alaska. Liechtenstein was also awarded a small port in the Russian Far-East. The plan for Liechtenstein to reach Alaska is to travel troguh the Trans-Siberian Railroad to their port city, then hop to a ship and reach Alaska. \n\n Alaska became important after the Alaskan Gold Rush in 1896. The territory didn't profit from mining for gold, but they were providing services to people looking for easy profit there. Many people went in Liechtenstein's Alaska not to mine for gold, but to provide services, which was more profitable than digging for gold. \n\n Watch "What if Liechtenstein had bought Alaska in 1867?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.5.t:0 "History Of The Ottoman Empire"
  RGW_lore.5.d:0 "The Sick Man of Europe is nearing its end. The Ottoman Empire has been centuries in a decline, and anyone trying to deny that is living in a delusion. Even within the Ottoman Empire, the rulers know it. After the devastating defeat in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, Bulgaria was released and untied with Serbia. \n\n While the Serbo-Bulgarian nation is obeying Ottoman rule, with the everchanging balance of power in Europe, anything is possible. We must destroy Serbo-Bulgaria before other Major Power backs them. \n\n The Ottoman Empire sold Libya and Tunisia to San Marino, in exchange for guarantees. Monaco was forced to also promise not to interfere in the Balkan politics. \n\n The greatest enemy of the Ottoman Empire is not their rival of Russia, but the British, who are becoming too powerful in every corner of the Earth. We must try and gain control over Egypt and the Suez Canal at all costs. This would break the British and force them to nagotiate with us."

  RGW_lore.6.t:0 "History Of The USA"
  RGW_lore.6.d:0 "The United States of America never managed to reach the Pacific Ocean. This is because in 1835 the Toledo War happened. There the state of Ohio and the territory of Michigan clashed over the Toledo Strip, which both claimed as theirs. The conflict escalated and there were hundreds dead. \n\n President Andrew Jackson directly intervened to put an end to the conflict, with him siding with Ohio. This was a clear sign of "state privilege" so naturally, many territories wanted to be granted statehood. The problem was that these territories were not ready to become states and couldn't provide for themselves financially. \n\n Many states in the Union questioned why are they sending money to other states, who cannot provide from themselves. The problem only became worse when in 1846 the US invaded Mexico. If the United States were victorious, they would gain more states, which is more problems. If they lose, they would have to pay war reparations. Neither worked for the US, so they fell into a big depression. \n\n Watch "What if the Toledo War Collapsed the USA in 1848?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.7.d:0 "The Spanish Monarchy managed to keep some of their colonies around the world, most notibly Cuba and Puerto Rico. This is because the United States of America never invaded in 1898, starting the Spanish-American War. This allowed the Spanish to gain a bit more land in the Scramble For Africa. \n\n Spain was in a conflict with the United Kingdom, where the Spanish lost the Philippines, but gained a port city in India and regained Gibraltar. Now the Spanish Monarchy is more stable, but still plagued by corruption and unequality \n\n Watch "What if Spain won the Spanish-American war in 1898?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.8.t:0 "History Of The United Kingdom"
  RGW_lore.8.d:0 "The United Kingdom is undoubtedly the strongest country in the world at that point. They have the largest colonial empire and are the most populated empire. The country has given up on the European continent and has focused on expanding their colonial empire. \n\n Right after the Franco-Prussian war of 1871, the British initiated the Scramble for Africa, as to prevent the new French monarchy, headed by Monaco, to become a rival. The British also succesfully set up the colonies promised to Austria and Germany as to spark a conflict between the two nations. \n\n The United Kingdom doesn't need to ally with any country to remain on top, they can single handedly defeat anyone in the world right now. The number one priority is to prevent an alliance between other Great Powers, as to preserve the British hegemony over the world. \n\n Each European country has their own interests in mind is is very selfish. We have succesfully set the situation up to ensure that nobody will ally and they will only go to war, as we grow stronger!"

  RGW_lore.9.t:0 "History Of The German Empire"
  RGW_lore.9.d:0 "The Germans defeated the French so bad in 1871, that the House of Monaco took over France. As for the Germans, it meant that Monaco on the west would be a neutral country and maybe an ally. Monaco doesn't hold a grudge on Alsace Lorraine the same way that France did historically \n\n The Germans didn't gain a whole lot in terms of colonies by the time of the Scramble for Africa - they only gained Namibia and Tanganyika. \n\n The Austrians were awarded more land, which pissed the Germans. This is why Germany invaded Austria in 1890 and managed to steal all of ther colonies abroad. The Germans are now internationally isolated and their best bet for alliance is with Monaco or Sweden-Norway."

  RGW_lore.10.t:0 "History Of Austria"
  RGW_lore.10.d:0 "The Austrian empire never reformed to establish the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. This made them weaker in the short term, with the Germans knowing this. This is the reason why the two countries don't have good relations. \n\n In 1890 Austria and Germany fought a war regarding the colonies. Austria was initially promised Togo, Upper Volta, and Middle Congo. They controlled these colonies for 10 years, but the Germans invaded, taking control of these colonies. \n\n This ruined a possibly alliance between Austria and Germany and now both countries are internationally isolated. Now Austria is in between a rock and a hard place. The country cannot expand colonially, and they cannot in Europe. \n\n If Austria takes territories from Serbo-Bulgaria, Romania, Montenegro, or the Ottoman Empire, this would only add more national minorities. Unless there is a quick reform, Austira in this form would not get to see the next decade."

  RGW_lore.11.t:0 "History Of Sweden-Norway"
  RGW_lore.11.d:0 "Sweden and Norway became united in 1815, right after the Napleonic Wars. Before that, Norway was controlled by Denmark for hundreds of wars, but the Danes just kept losing wars after wars, with their size being redused over time. When Norway joined the Union, they would adopt a more liberal constitution, rather than to revise it many times. \n\n Sweden-Norway managed to remain united because in 1884, both countries adopted parliamentary rule. The issue of debt owed to Sweden from Denmark-Norway would be resolved, with Sweden forgiving the debt, so they can secure good relations with both countries. A railroad connecting Stockhold and Cristiania would begin construction immediately after the countries unite. \n\n Watch "What if Norway never broke away from Sweden in 1905?" on YouTube if you want to learn more!"

  RGW_lore.12.t:0 "History Of Mexico"
  RGW_lore.12.d:0 "The Mexicans were victorious in the Mexican-American war of 1846, due to domestic problems on the side of the United States. Right after the conclusion of the conflict, large deposits of gold were found in California, starting the Californian Gold Rush from 1848 to 1855. \n\n This was a great opportunity for the Mexicans to populate their northern territories. Many British Canadians and Americans migrated to California, establishing settlements. This is bad news, since now many English speakers call California home, giving these countries an excuse to invade. \n\n After the French tried to puppet Mexico in 1864-1867, the Mexican people were more wary of European expansion. A Third Mexican Empire was proclaimed, with it's goal to preserve their lands and gain infuence in Central America. \n\n The Mexican government is now more capable, but corruption is even more rampant. Can Mexico survive a possible attack from the USA in the future?"

  RGW_lore.13.t:0 "History Of Qing China"
  RGW_lore.13.d:0 "The Chinese Century of Humiliation never happens, as Qing China manages to win the First Opium War. This means that Hong-Kong never becomes British and the foreigners in China play a less significant role. The Taiping and the Boxer Rebellions never happen in this timeline, as the Qing is stronger and not exploited by foreign powers. \n\n The Chinese are not industrialized and still remain an agrarian society. The need for industrialization is not there, as China has no shortage of manual labor. Industrialization needs to happen, but it needs to happen slowly, as to not put millions of Chinese without jobs, this would create a revolution."

  RGW_lore.14.d:0 "During the Edo period of Japanese History, the country was isolated from foreign policy and trade for 250 years, from 1603 to 1868. The country opened up because of expeditions send by Western Countries like the United States of America. \n\n In this timeline, Japan would remain mostly isolated in the beginning, allowing European countries to trade with them only in specific locations, like the port city of Nagasaki. \n\n The Europeans started to explot Japan more and more, putting unequal treaties on the nation. Since China is not carved up by foreign powers, Japan would take up this role. The Japanese Century of Humiliation is still ongoing."

  RGW_lore.15.d:0 "The Philippines used to be a Spanish colony, but the Spanish and the British had a brief scirmish. As part of the peace treaty, the Philippines were given to the United Kingdom. \n\n We must secure our own interests and try to break away from the United Kingdom's tyrrany!"

  RGW_lore.16.d:0 "The Russians are in a strong state as they have the highest population in Europe. The nation is slowly moving towards industrialization, surpasing other European countries in terms of development. \n\n These actions are seen as a thread by the British Empire. If we industrialize past a certain treshhold, the United Kingdom would declare war on us. \n\n It doesn't help that the Great Russian Empire cannot ally with any other country due to many disagreements  and no natural allies. The historical Russian ally at the time was France, which doesn't exist in the same form in this timeline."
