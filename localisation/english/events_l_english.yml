 RGW_news.1.d:0 "The mod combines several YouTube alternate history scenarios into one. You can see the country lore by checking the country's ideas, also known as buffs and debuffs. \n\n Each country's lore was based on a unique YouTube video. There you can watch how the country actually managed to achieve what they have in the mod. You can check out my YouTube channel - Rewriting History. \n\n Have fun playing and thank you for stopping by!"
