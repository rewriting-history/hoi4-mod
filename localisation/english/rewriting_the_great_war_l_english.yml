France is controlled by the House of Monaco and Italy - by San Marino. The Ottoman Empire lost a decisive war to Russia, allowing for Serbo-Bulgaria to become an Ottoman Puppet. Any wrong move, and the whole continent would suddenly find itself at war!"
 MCO_RGW_desc:0 "Monaco came to rule over France in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War. The way this was achieved was by the incopetence of the French Monarch - Napoleon III. He was lacking funding for the war, so he decided to gamble French territory in Monte Carlo. Due to unfortuante streak of events, he had lost everything. The people mostly accepted the House of Monaco ruling over France, but some think it's time for a change. After the House of Monaco took over, they put their economic model on what used to be France. This means that the people of Monaco don't pay any taxes, instead, money for the government is received from the many Casinos."
 SAN_RGW_desc:0 "San Marino became a player in the Appenine Peninsula when Napoleon Bonaparte of France rose to power. Napoleon liked San Marino and wrote in a letter to the country, offering to extend their size accoding to their needs. San Marino takes the offer and gets access to the Adriatic Sea and the province of Tuscany. Sardinia-Piedmont was expanding in the North of Italy, so they felt confident they can take San Marino. Eventually, San Marino united all of Northern Italy and after Guiseppe Garibaldi's expedition to the Two Sicilies, the country was given to San Marino, finally uniting the Appenine Peninsula."
